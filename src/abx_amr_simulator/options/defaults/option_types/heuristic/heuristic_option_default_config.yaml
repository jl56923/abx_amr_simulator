# Default config for heuristic option
# Heuristic worker prescribes based on expected reward thresholds and uncertainty.
#
# duration: number of steps this worker runs before manager can switch (k)
# action_thresholds: dict mapping action keys -> minimum expected reward to take that action
#   Keys format: 'prescribe_{antibiotic_name}' or 'no_treatment'
#   Lower thresholds = more aggressive (prescribe even with modest expected reward)
#   Higher thresholds = more conservative (only prescribe when very confident)
# uncertainty_threshold: max uncertainty score before refusing to prescribe (default 2.0)
#   Interpretation: if uncertainty > threshold, default to no_treatment
